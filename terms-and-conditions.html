Crude Exchange, LLC – Terms and Conditions of Use<br><br>

CrudeX owns and provides an electronic platform featuring a methodology to identify potential purchasers and sellers of crude oil, trade wellhead production, track volumes, and provide trading data for monitoring markets (the “Platform”).<br><br>

User desires, and CrudeX agrees to provide to User, a non-exclusive right to access the Platform, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.<br><br>

Use of the Platform constitutes your unconditional agreement to follow and be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Use. If you (the "User") do not agree to them, do not use the Platform. CrudeX reserve the right to update or modify these Terms and Conditions at any time without prior notice to User. These Terms and Conditions of Use apply to the use of our Platform and do not extend to any linked third party sites.<br><br>

In consideration of the foregoing recitals and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, CrudeX and User (each, a “Party” and, collectively, the “Parties”) agree as follows:<br><br>

Services<br><br>

Access. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, CrudeX hereby grants to User, for the term hereof, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, revocable right to (A) access and use the functionality of the Platform via www.CrudeX.com (“Website”), and (B) use any documentation or other materials relating to the Platform as CrudeX may provide to User during the term of this Agreement (collectively, “Documentation”), in each case, solely for User’s business purposes (the foregoing collectively being the “Services”). CrudeX reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or change the Services, including the Platform and the Documentation, at any time, provided the Services still serve to connect buyers and sellers of crude oil. As used in this Agreement, “Platform” and “Documentation” shall include any and all modifications thereof as CrudeX may make available under this Agreement. Use of the Services by User following any modification thereof shall constitute acceptance by User of such modification.<br><br>

Access Methods. The Services may be accessed only by using such user names or other access methods as are assigned to User by CrudeX (collectively, “Access Methods”), which Access Methods shall be for use only by User and those employees of User designated by the User Liaison (as defined below) in accordance with such procedures as CrudeX specifies. User shall not, and shall not permit any other individual or entity to, disclose User’s Access Methods to any third party. User shall be solely responsible for (i) maintaining the confidentiality of User’s Access Methods; (ii) all transactions and other activities undertaken by users of User’s Access Methods, whether authorized or not, and all charges resulting therefrom; (iii) ensuring User’s Access Methods are not used by any third party or other unauthorized individual or entity; and (iv) notifying CrudeX immediately of any unauthorized use of User’s Access Methods or any other known or suspected breach of security relative to the Services.<br><br>

Connectivity. User shall access the Services via the Website using such methods of connectivity, personal computers, and other communication devices and technology, including firewalls, as the User provides at its sole expense (“User Technology”). All such User Technology used to access the Services shall conform to any and all specifications therefor as may be posted by CrudeX via the Website, which specifications may be modified by CrudeX from time to time.<br><br>

User Liaison. As a condition precedent to CrudeX granting User access to the Services hereunder, User shall provide CrudeX with the information requested during Website registration. The User Liaison shall (i) designate those employees of User authorized to access the Services on User’s behalf (together with the User Liaison, the “Authorized Users”), (ii) be authorized to enter binding bids on behalf of User in the Platform, (iii) enter offering information; and (iv) otherwise be responsible for all communications between User, its counterparty, and CrudeX.<br><br>

Restrictions on Use. Without CrudeX’s prior written consent, except as otherwise expressly permitted under this Agreement, User shall not, and shall not permit any other individual or entity to: (i) modify, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble the Platform or create derivative works based on the Platform; (ii) reproduce, copy, display, access, download, print, store, transfer, assign, sell, lease, license, distribute or otherwise commercially exploit, or make available to any third party, the Services, the Platform, or the Documentation; (iii) remove or deface any notice of confidentiality or any trademark or other indicia of ownership that may be contained on or displayed via the Services, including in the Platform or Documentation; (iv) create any hyperlinks to any website via which the Services, the Platform or the Documentation may be accessed, or frame or mirror any content contained in or accessible via, the Website, the Platform, or any Documentation; (v) misstate or omit information that User provides or is required to provide CrudeX or to other users of the Platform; (vi) manipulate or attempt to manipulate prices, including by disseminating inaccurate information, reporting false transactions, posting bids or offers that are not bona fide, or otherwise performing any act designed or intended to manipulate prices; (vii) use the Services, including the Platform, to further any unlawful purpose or to otherwise undertake any activities that reasonably can be expected to be harmful to or otherwise interfere with the Services, the use thereof by any other user, or any system, network or equipment of CrudeX or any third party, including (a) intercepting or attempting to intercept any material transmitted over the Platform, (b) sending transmissions that impose a disproportionately large load on the Platform, either directly or by relaying, (c) posting or transmitting via the Services information or material that infringes or otherwise violates any copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary right, or contains or embodies a virus, worm, Trojan horse or other contaminating or destructive feature, and (d) violating or attempting to violate the security of the Platform or interfere or attempt to interfere with CrudeX’s systems, networks, authentication measures, servers or equipment; or (viii) otherwise act in any manner detrimental to the interests, welfare or integrity of the Platform, its users or CrudeX.<br><br>

Transactions<br><br>

Instructions. User acknowledges and agrees that all instructions issued by User via its Access Methods, including instructions or orders entered via the Services, may be relied upon by CrudeX as duly authorized and binding, and CrudeX shall have no duty to investigate the accuracy thereof or the authenticity of authority thereby authorized.<br><br>

Accuracy and Adequacy of Data. User accepts sole responsibility (i) for the accuracy and adequacy of data entered into the Platform by User or any other individual or entity using User’s Access Methods, and for all results obtained from use of the Services by User or any other individual or entity using User’s Access Methods; (ii) for reconstructing data for purposes of re-entry in the event of a Platform malfunction, and (iii) for confirming the accuracy of all data, including trading data, supplied or received by User via the Services or via communications with CrudeX. In the event User becomes aware of an error in any trading data provided by CrudeX or in any entry submitted via the Services by or on behalf of User, User shall promptly so notify CrudeX and, to the extent applicable and reasonably feasible, shall withdraw any erroneous entry.<br><br>

Settlement of Bilateral Transactions; Penalties.<br><br>

User understands and agrees that all transactions concluded on or through the Platform are binding transactions between User and its counterparty that must be settled between User and its counterparty consistent with the material terms of the transaction as listed on the Platform, and with applicable agreements between User and its counterparty and any other customary terms and conditions of the trade. In no event will CrudeX be a counterparty, either directly or indirectly, to any posting or transaction concluded on or through the Platform or for delivery of or payment for any product resulting from a transaction concluded on or through the Platform. Under no circumstances shall CrudeX be liable to User as a result of User’s counterparty to a transaction failing to consummate and/or perform such transaction for any reason.<br><br>

User is legally bound by any bid it places for the purchase of crude oil on the Platform. If User places a bid for the purchase of crude oil that is accepted, and User fails to consummate the transaction in question with its counterparty (who is ready, willing, and able to consummate such transaction), User remains liable to pay CrudeX the Fee that CrudeX would have received had the transaction been completed.<br><br>

Suspension. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in addition to, and without limitation of, any other rights or remedies as CrudeX may have under this Agreement or applicable law, CrudeX may, in its sole discretion and without liability to User, suspend the rights of User and/or one of more of its Authorized Users to access and use the Services, permanently, or for such length of time as CrudeX, in its sole discretion, believes necessary or advisable, including in the event of any activity which detrimentally affects, or CrudeX reasonably believes may adversely affect, CrudeX’s ability to comply with any applicable laws, rules and/or regulations or any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. CrudeX will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify User as soon as reasonably practicable as to the reason and anticipated duration of any such suspension.<br><br>

Fees<br><br>

Definition. In partial consideration for the rights granted to User hereunder, User acknowledges and agrees that User shall pay to CrudeX the applicable fees for the transaction, which will be identified by CrudeX on the applicable listing of crude oil on the Platform (the “Fees”). The Fee charged to User by CrudeX is Confidential Information, and User agrees that it shall not disclose such fee to any third party, including User’s counterparty to the transaction in question.<br><br>

Payment. CrudeX will invoice User on the 10th day of each month for any Fees incurred by User with regard to transactions concluded during the immediately preceding calendar month, and such invoiced Fees shall be due and payable within ten (10) days after the invoice date therefor. The Fees shall be exclusive of all taxes, levies, duties or similar charges, however designated, that may be assessed by any (i) international, federal, state, municipal or other jurisdiction, however designated (collectively “Taxes”), and User shall be responsible for all Taxes arising out of this Agreement, other than any Taxes assessed or levied on CrudeX in respect of revenue earned by CrudeX pursuant to this Agreement. If User fails to pay any Fees or other charges when due under this Agreement, then interest shall be charged thereon from the date of issuance of the applicable invoice until the date payment is made, at the rate of the lesser of (i) one and one half percent (1.5%) per month, and (ii) the maximum amount allowed under applicable law.<br><br>

Term and Termination<br><br>

Subject to those provisions that survive termination of this Agreement, the term of the Agreement shall commence upon the first use of the website and shall continue until account is terminated and unless this Agreement is terminated in writing by either Party. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, User shall (i) cease immediately all uses of the Services, the Platform, the Documentation and any Access Methods assigned to User hereunder, (ii) destroy or return to CrudeX all tangible materials (and all copies thereof) provided by CrudeX (or its third party service providers) hereunder, and (iii) certify in writing to CrudeX that such materials have been destroyed and/or returned and no portion thereof remain in User’s possession or control. The termination of this Agreement for any reason will not affect the accrued rights of the Parties or the right of either Party to sue for damages arising from a breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, User shall remain liable to pay CrudeX all Fees due or accruing on or prior to the effective date of such termination. Applicable sections shall survive beyond the effective date of termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect.<br><br>

Confidentiality<br><br>

Confidential Information. Any and all non-public information, in any form, obtained hereunder by either Party through the Platform or otherwise arising out of or related to the provision or use of the Services shall be deemed to be “Confidential Information.” Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, CrudeX’s Confidential Information shall specifically include all source code of the Platform, and all Documentation. This section shall also apply to protect the confidential information of other users of the Platform. All information relating to any other user of the Platform – including, without limitation, information such as the term, delivery, location, price, and volume of crude oil such user is selling/purchasing through the Platform – shall be presumed to be Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, “Confidential Information” will not include any information that: (a) is in or becomes part of the public domain (other than by disclosure by the receiving Party or its employees, agents or contractors in violation of this Agreement); (b) was previously known to the receiving Party free of restriction; (c) is independently developed by the receiving Party, without reference to the Confidential Information of the disclosing Party; or (d) is lawfully obtained by the receiving Party from a third party having the right to furnish such information.<br><br>

Nondisclosure. Each Party shall hold in strict confidence the Confidential Information of the other Party and any third-party user of the Platform, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any third party or use such Confidential Information for any purpose not expressly permitted under this Agreement; except that a Party may disclose Confidential Information of the other Party and other users of the Platform solely to those of its employees, agents or contractors who have a need to know such Confidential Information to facilitate performance of this Agreement and who are required by written contract to protect the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in a manner no less protective of such Confidential Information than the requirements of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information may be disclosed (i) to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, or (ii) pursuant to a subpoena or order of a court or regulatory, self-regulatory or legislative body of competent jurisdiction, provided that the Party receiving such subpoena or order immediately notifies the other party thereof and cooperates with such party to obtain a protective order or other appropriate confidential treatment of any Confidential Information to be so disclosed. Moreover, User expressly acknowledges and understands that information provided by User to CrudeX for use on the Website will be available to other users of the Platform. User agrees that CrudeX shall not be liable for the unauthorized disclosure of User’s information by any third-party user of the Platform.<br><br>

User’s Trading Data. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, CrudeX may summarize, use and/or disclose, for any purpose as CrudeX may in its sole discretion determine, commodity, term, delivery location, price, and volume data and other data provided or received by User under this Agreement in connection with its use of the Services (collectively, “User Data”); provided that no such use shall identify User as the source of such User Data except in the context of identifying User as a counterparty to a transaction at the conclusion of such transaction, and provided further that the foregoing shall not restrict CrudeX from identifying User as a user of CrudeX to which CrudeX provides the Services.<br><br>

Exclusive Right to Sell; Non-Circumvention<br><br>

User agrees that it shall not circumvent CrudeX to purchase any crude oil listed on the Platform directly from the seller of such crude oil so as to avoid payment to CrudeX of the Fees that would otherwise be due under this Agreement. If User, circumventing the Platform, enters into a binding contract to purchase any crude oil that is/was listed on the Platform during the term of this Agreement, and User and its counterparty are not collectively obligated, able, and willing to pay CrudeX the Fees that CrudeX would have been entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement if such purchase was made via the Platform, User shall be liable to pay all such Fees to CrudeX.<br><br>

Proprietary Rights<br><br>

CrudeX or its third party service providers, as applicable, shall own and retain ownership of all rights, title and interest in and to (i) the Services and all underlying technology and all materials provided by CrudeX (or its third party service providers) in connection therewith, including the Platform and the Documentation; (ii) all updates, modifications, enhancements and new versions to or of the foregoing, and all derivative works based thereon; and (iii) all copyrights, patents, trade secrets, database rights and other intellectual property associated with the foregoing. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no licenses or other intellectual property rights are granted to User under this Agreement. User hereby waives any and all challenges to, or claims or defenses regarding, (a) CrudeX’s rights in the Services, Platform and the Documentation, and (b) CrudeX’s right to revoke the rights of access granted to User herein.<br><br>

Warranties<br><br>

User represents and warrants that: (i) it has the power and authority, corporate and otherwise, to execute and perform this Agreement; (ii) neither its execution of this Agreement nor the performance of its obligations or exercise of its rights under this Agreement will violate any law, rule, regulation, order or other agreement or other obligation to which it is bound; (iii) User is registered and/or qualified to do business in those states and other jurisdictions where its business requires such registration and/or qualifications, and will remain so registered or qualified at all times it utilizes the Services; (iv) in respect of all transactions into which User enters via the Platform, it is entering into such transactions as a principal; (v) all orders, instructions and other information User transmits via the Services, or otherwise provides to CrudeX, including User Data, shall be accurate and complete.

Limitation of Liability<br><br>

EXCLUDING ANY LIABILITY OF CRUDEX FOR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, USER AGREES THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL CRUDEX BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, TRADING LOSSES OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND THE LIKE, ARISING IN ANY MANNER WHATSOEVER OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY USE (WHETHER OR NOT AUTHORIZED) OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, PLATFORM, DOCUMENTATION, OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION OR MATERIALS PROVIDED BY CRUDEX OR ACCESSIBLE VIA THE SERVICES, INCLUDING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, QUALITY, SECURITY, PERFORMANCE, OR PRICING OF THE SERVICES OR ANY FAILURES, DEGRADATIONS OR DELAYS ASSOCIATED THEREWITH, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARISE IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, AND EVEN IF CRUDEX HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF A COURT OR OTHER TRIBUNAL OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION SHOULD FIND CRUDEX LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR EXPENSES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF CRUDEX UNDER THE AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FEES PAID BY USER TO CRUDEX DURING THE THREE (3) CALENDAR MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE ACT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.<br><br>

Indemnification<br><br>

User shall defend, indemnify and hold CrudeX, its affiliates, and the respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives of CrudeX and its affiliates (“CrudeX Indemnitees”) harmless from and against all costs, claims, demands, losses, expenses and liabilities of any nature whatsoever (including reasonable attorney’s fees) incurred or suffered by such CrudeX Indemnitees (“Losses”) arising out of, or in connection with, any third party claim, demand, or cause of action (each, a “Claim”) based upon or arising out of (i) use of the Services, or any other information or materials provided by CrudeX or accessible via the Services, by User or any other entity or individual using any of User’s Access Methods, whether or not authorized, except to the extent such Losses are proximately caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of CrudeX, (ii) breach of any of User’s obligations, representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement, and/or (iii) User’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Equitable Remedies<br><br>

User acknowledges and agrees that the violation of its obligations would cause irreparable harm to CrudeX, which harm may not be compensable solely by monetary damages, and that, therefore, in the event of an actual or threatened breach thereof by User, CrudeX shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief, without the necessity of proving monetary damages or posting a bond or other security. Any such equitable relief granted shall be without prejudice to any other rights and remedies as CrudeX may have under this Agreement.<br><br>

Force Majeure<br><br>

If the performance of this Agreement by CrudeX is prevented, hindered, delayed or otherwise made impracticable by reason of any cause beyond CrudeX’s reasonable control (including any flood, riot, fire, act of terrorism, and judicial or governmental action) (each, a “Force Majeure Event”), CrudeX shall be excused from such performance to the extent, including for the duration of time, that it is prevented, hindered or delayed by such Force Majeure Event.<br><br>

Binding Provisions/Third Party Beneficiaries<br><br>

This Agreement is binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Parties and their respective administrators, legal representatives, successors, and permitted assigns.

Relationship<br><br>

Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute or be deemed to establish a partnership, joint venture, association or employment relationship between the Parties hereto, and neither Party shall have the authority or power to bind the other Party, or to contract in the name of the other Party, in any manner or for any purpose.<br><br>

Assignment and Sublicensing<br><br>

User shall not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement, or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written approval of CrudeX. For purposes of this section, any assignment by User, whether by operation of law, under an order of any court, or pursuant to any plan of merger, consolidation or liquidation, shall be deemed an assignment for which CrudeX’s prior written consent is required, and any assignment made without such consent shall be void and of no effect as between the Parties hereto.<br><br>

Separability of Provisions.<br><br>

Each provision of this Agreement shall be considered separable; and if, for any reason, any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement or the validity, lawfulness, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.<br><br>

Waiver<br><br>

The failure of a Party to exercise or enforce any right conferred upon it by this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any such right or operate so as to bar the exercise or enforcement thereof at any time or times thereafter. No waiver by either Party hereunder shall be effective unless agreed to pursuant to a writing signed by an authorized representative of each Party.<br><br>

Remedies Not Exclusive<br><br>

No remedy conferred by any provision of this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing in law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.<br><br>

Interpretation<br><br>

References to sections and exhibits are to sections of, and exhibits to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. Section headings are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement. The singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa.
